## ICD9 Lookup

A couchapp for looking up ICD-9 codes, since all the free lookup versions I could find were HTML with lots of adds, rather than a nice JSON/JSONP.

Should eventually have an export as RDF, JSON, or CSV.

### Source Data

Data originally came from [CMS.gov](https://www.cms.gov/ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/downloads/cmsv29_master_descriptions.zip "CMS.gov Diagnosis and Procedure Codes").
